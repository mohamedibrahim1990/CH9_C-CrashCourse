Roughly, the matching process proceeds as follows:

The compiler will look for an exact type match.
The compiler will try using integral and floating-point promotions to get a suitable overload (for example, int to long or float to double).
The compiler will try to match using standard conversions like integral type to floating-point or casting a pointer-to-child into a pointer-to-parent.
The compiler will look for a user-defined conversion.
The compiler will look for a variadic function.
